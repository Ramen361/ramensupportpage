                    I spend a lot of time learning about therapy techniques, self-care, and emotional support strategies. Helping people feel seen and understood is extremely important to me, and I love finding ways to support friends and community members in meaningful ways.<br><br>
                    I really enjoy being there for friends, whether it’s having deep conversations, offering advice, or just listening. Building supportive, caring connections is something I genuinely value.<br><br>
                    I’m curious about human behavior, psychology, and different ways to improve emotional and mental well-being. I try to care for others and be understanding, and people often say I’m trustworthy and that I make them feel safe, which is really meaningful to me.<br><br>
                    I also have a growing interest in coding! I’ve learned HTML and CSS, and I’ve experimented a little with Python and JavaScript. I enjoy creating small projects and consider myself mostly a “vibe-coder”—I like experimenting, trying out fun ideas, and seeing what I can build. I don’t plan to make a career out of it; it’s just something I enjoy playing with and learning from.
